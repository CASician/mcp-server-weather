# MCP Server
This is a copy of the tutorial on modelcontextprotocol.io
that uses groq api instead of anthropic.

This server exposes functions that the llm-client/agent can call.

## How to use
1. copy repo
2. start the server with ```python weather.py```
3. start the client (if you don't have one, check this [basic one](https://github.com/CASician/mcp-client-weather))
4. ask your query.
